                <p>The debate between laptops and desktops has been ongoing for years, with both sides having their own merits.
                    On one hand, laptops offer portability and convenience, allowing users to take their work or entertainment on the go. 
                    On the other hand, desktops offer greater power and upgradability, making them ideal for demanding applications such as gaming or video editing. 
                    Ultimately, the choice between a laptop and a desktop depends on your specific needs and preferences.

                <h4><strong>What does a laptop offer?</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    The laptop has always been a powerful portable device, but is that all it has to offer? A laptop helps anyone in any field create and work whenever and wherever
                    they are. This is a major advantage compared to a desktop. Desktop's can only be used in one place, unless you want to go through the struggle of moving it with you
                    wherever you go. Laptops also offer exclusive features such as touchscreens, trackpads, and even being able to turn into a tablet!

                <h4><strong>What does a desktop offer?</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    The desktop although lacks the portability that the laptop offers, redeems itself with its power and potential. Want more RAM? Go ahead install additional RAM! Want more
                    processing power? Install a new CPU! The desktop allows a person to upgrade and swap components without having to buy a completely new system. It also does not need to worry
                    about battery life that the laptop struggles with. You recently started to edit videos or want to wind down and play some video games? Go ahead! A desktop provides more power to
                    do these things without worrying about integrated graphics that a laptop has.
